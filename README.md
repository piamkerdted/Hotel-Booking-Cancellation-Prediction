# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction

These are various classification models to predict whether a hotel booking will get canceled or not, built using Python. The goal is to reduce a travel agency's 
revenue loss from uncertain cancellations. The script consists of EDA, data visualisations, and business analysis performed on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).

No special packages are required to run the script. Adapted from this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/chitwanmanchanda/eda-and-hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction).
